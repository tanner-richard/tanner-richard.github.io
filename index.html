		Below is a recent assignment I completed for INFO 3402. More work to come shortly.

		<h3>Instagram and The Bachelor</h3>

   		<p>American reality television is far from representing reality. Nearly every popular reality TV show has some aspect that makes it seem less than realistic. No show exemplifies this more than ABC’s The Bachelor. This dating show is full of staged dates, forced drama, and behind the scenes situational manipulation. However, one of the most unrealistsic aspects of the show is the contestants they select. Many of them do not come to the show to actually find a long-term partner. Many come on the show simply to gain more media attention and create drama. A good prediction of contestants intentions is the number of instagram followers they have before coming on the show. In this essay, I explore this relationship using data from <a href="https://data.world/amandanovak/bachelor-contestants-with-instagram-follower-count">data.world</a>.
   	<p>	
		A frequent topic of contestants in the show is whether or not they are there for the “right reasons.” While there is no official definition for this concept, it’s generally accepted that this means looking for a genuine connection and a long-term serious relationship. (<a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/the-bachelor-what-does-here-for-the-right-reasons-mean.html/">Source</a>). While there is no exact metric for measuring if a contestant is actually there for the right reasons, the bachelor usually picks up on the contestants that are less than genuine. How then does social media play into this concept of “here for the right reasons?” See visualization below. 
	</p>

	<p>
		This visualization reveals a clear pattern between the number of followers a contestant has and the amount of time that they last on the show. However, the datasource did not elaborate on whether or not these followers were gained before or after the show has been aired. Regardless, this trend still reveals some interesting aspects of the show’s relationship to social instagram. The strong upward trend between elimination week and instagram followers suggests that being on this reality show can launch a contestant into fame if they do well. This suggests that many prospective contestants have discovered this and are joining the show to boost their social media presence. (<a href="https://www.vox.com/reset/2020/2/24/21145335/the-bachelor-instagram-social-media-influencers-money">Source</a>). Joining the show for the sole purpose of gaining social media followers would not be considered “the right reason” however, it is certainly a resourceful thing to do, even if one does not make it very far. The average number of Instagram followers for a contestant on the show is 193,828, demonstrating the power of the show to gain contestants a media presence. 
	</p>
		<p>
		Despite the potential for incredible popularity that The Bachelor provides, there are large consequences for contestants caused by social media. The existence of social media means that outside factors can influence the outcome of the show and the rest of contestants’ lives. Past controversies often come up during the course of the show. Contestants are frequently questioned about their past social media interactions and motivations. (<a href="https://medium.com/swlh/how-social-media-changed-reality-tv-c4cb3e725a86">Source</a>).  Additionally, contestants’ behavior on the show will follow them on social media for the rest of their lives. 
		</p>
	<p>
		Overall, both social media and The Bachelor demonstrate just how easy it is for reality to be misrepresented. I would argue that goin on a reality TV show just to gain Instagram followers is an incredibly trivial pursuit. However, the financial gain that often comes with social media fame is undeniable. I predict that the future of American reality television will be defined by influencers seeking fame and fortune.

                            <div>I wanted to take a unique approach to the redesign of my website. I started with a <a href="https://startbootstrap.com/theme/resume">bootstrap template</a> then preceded to add a few of my own features. I combined my contact page with my about page for increased fluidity. One of the most distinct bootstrap features utilized in the website is the navigation bar. Even though the entire website exists on one continuous page, I still use a navigation bar to take the user to the different subsections of the page. Try out the feature below or on the sidebar.</div>
